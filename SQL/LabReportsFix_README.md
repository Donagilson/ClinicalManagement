# 🏥 Clinical Management System - Complete Lab Reports Fix

## ✅ **Problem Solved**
Fixed the `SqlException: Invalid column name` errors when lab technicians try to complete lab tests.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Missing Database Table**
- **Issue**: `TblLabReports` table was missing from the database
- **Solution**: Created complete table structure with all required columns:
  - `LabReportId` (Primary Key)
  - `ReportCode` (Unique identifier)
  - `PatientId`, `LabTestId`, `DoctorId`, `LabTechnicianId` (Foreign Keys)
  - `CollectionDate`, `ReportDate` (Dates)
  - `ResultValue`, `ResultUnit` (Test results)
  - `Findings`, `Notes` (Comments)
  - `Status`, `CreatedDate` (Audit fields)

### **2. Enhanced Repository Methods**
- **Updated `GetLabReportsByDoctorAsync()`** to include patient, test, and technician names
- **Updated `GetLabReportByIdAsync()`** with complete details for views
- **Maintained existing `AddLabReportAsync()`** functionality

### **3. New Doctor Features**
- **Added `LabReports()` action** - View all completed lab reports
- **Added `LabReportDetails()` action** - View detailed report information
- **Added navigation** - Quick access from doctor dashboard
- **Added comprehensive views** with proper styling and information display

### **4. Complete Workflow Integration**
- **Lab Technician completes test** → Creates lab report in database
- **Report automatically linked** to prescribing doctor
- **Doctor can view** all their patients' completed lab reports
- **Full audit trail** maintained throughout the process

## 📋 **Database Setup Required**
